#Circle packing

A Very simple windows forms application, where you drag and drop an image and it will convert it into a series of circles.
Theese circles follow certain rules. They cannot intersect with one and another and they cannot intersect with the border, that results in the circles touching.
You can modify their min and max sizes, thickness and ammount of them.

It is a very unoptimized algorithm.
